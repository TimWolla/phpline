Description
-----------

PHPLine is a PHP library for handling console input. It is similar in functionality to [BSD editline](http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline/) and [GNU readline](http://www.gnu.org/s/readline/). People familiar with the readline/editline capabilities for modern shells (such as bash and tcsh) will find most of the command editing features of PHPLine to be familiar.

PHPLine is based on [JLine2](https://github.com/jline/jline2) and aims at being almost fully API-compatible to it.
